                    of the wise answers which he gave to every question.</p>
                <p>The king <a href="#2" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/king.png" alt=""></a> of
                    the country, known for being the wisest man who has ever owned a piece of land, heard the rumors
                    about the sheperd boy's wisdom and did not believed in them.</p>
                <p>The king sought for advice from the Council Of The Sages Of The Kingdom <a href="#3"
                        class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/sage.png" alt=""></a>, and The Sages told
                    him: </p>
                <p><span class="book__ident">-</span> Call the boy to come here to the palace and you will ask him
                    to answer three question that only the wisest of the men could answer.</p>
                <p>The advice was followed by the king and he sent word of the enquiry throughout the kingdom, an
                    order that was quickly obeyed.</p>
                <p>

                <p>The boy <a href="#1" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/shepherd.png" alt=""></a>
                    heard about the royal enquiry and went to the castle to answer the royal's enquiry.</p>
                <p>The shepherd boy barely arrived and the king was already saying: "If thou canst give me an answer
                    to three questions which I will ask thee, I will look on thee as my own child, and thou shall
                    dwell with me in my royal palace, because thou shalt be considered the wisest man who has ever
                    owned a piece of land".</p>
                <p>The boy said: "What are the three questions?" and the king <a href="#2" class="indicator"><img
                            src="./img/board-images/king.png"></a> aswered:</p>
                <p><span class="book__ident">-</span> The first question only the three Sages <a href="#btn3"
                        class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/sage.png" alt=""></a> were able to answer,
                    and the question is... "How many drops of water are there in the ocean?".</p>
                <p>And the sheperd boy very wisely said:</p>
                <span class="book__page-number"></span>
            </div>
            <div class="book__page">
                <p><span class="book__ident">-</span> Many time ago the a man walked through Earth and was tortured
                    to death, during his torture he wanted to run but he couldn't, because only blood was coming out
                    of his legs, he wanted to release the weight but he couldn't, because only blood was coming out
                    of his back, he wanted to cry but he couldn't, because only blood was coming out of his eyes.
                    Count the tears he never cried and you can know how many drops of water there are in the ocean.

                <p>The king <a href="#2" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/king.png" alt=""></a>,
                    impressed by the boy's answer, asked defiantly:</p>
                <p><span class="book__ident">-</span> If you are wise as it's said answer me the second question,
                    that only one of the three Sages <a href="#3" class="indicator"><img
                            src="./img/board-images/sage.png" alt=""></a> was able to answer, and the question is...
                    "How many stars are there in the sky?"</p>
                <p>And the sheperd boy very wisely said:</p>
                <p><span class="book__ident">-</span> Many time ago men lived above the skies and walked on clouds,
                    our lives - because they are our ancestors - were better than anything you can imagine here on
                    Earth.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="book__page">
                <p>Men lived like birds <a href="#4" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/bird.png"
                            alt=""></a> free to explore the skies from above it. But one thing bothered men, the
                    light that emanated from the sky.</p>
                <p>To stop the light from above the skies, men rebel against light <a href="#5" class="indicator"><img
                            src="./img/board-images/rebelion.png" alt=""></a> and hid themselves
                    in the clouds, placing them around their bodies.</p>
                <p>However the attempt to stop the light was frustated because men's bodies got havier and the
                    clouds were vanished from the skies, nothing could hold men in the skies anymore because they
                    weighted a lot and they had no more ground to step on... slowly everything began to crumble <a
                        href="#7" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/mountain.png" alt=""></a>.</p>
                <p>Men fell from the skies <a href="#6" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/falling.png"
                            alt=""></a> and their bodies turned into the ground
                    we walk over today.</p>
                <p>However the original place for men still are the skies above and every single time someone dies
                    that person goes up into the skies and forms a bright spot we call star.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="book__page">
                <p>So if you count how many skeletons are under the ground you will know how many stars are over the
                    skies.</p>
                <p>The king <a href="#2" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/king.png" alt=""></a>,
                    impressed by the boy's wisdom, asked defiantly:</p>
                <p><span class="book__ident">-</span> If you are wise as it's said answer me the third question,
                    that none of the sages throughout history, were able to answer, and the question is... "How much
                    is a second in eternity?".</p>
                <p>And the shepherd boy very wisely said:</p>
                <p>When men fell <a href="#6" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/falling.png" alt=""></a>
                    and formed the ground, many mountains were created from many different
                    metals, one of them was made with raw diamond and it holds a woman inside.</p>
                <p>What happens is that every century a little bird <a href="#4" class="indicator"><img
                            src="./img/board-images/bird.png" alt=""></a> passes by looking for love and on one of
                    its journeys he saw the woman trapped on the mountain of diamond.</p>
                <span class="book__page-number"></span>
            </div>
            <div class="book__page">
                <p>Since the first time the bird <a href="#4" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/bird.png"
                            alt=""></a> saw her, it goes to the top of that
                    mountain and takes out a diamond shard <a href="#8" class="indicator"><img
                            src="./img/board-images/pecking.png" alt=""></a>.</p>
                <p>Count how long it will take for the bird to leave the mountain at ground level <a href="#7"
                        class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/mountain.png" alt=""></a> and you will know
                    how much is a second in eternity.</p>
                <p><span class="book__ident">-</span> Impossible! - the king <a href="#2" class="indicator"><img
                            src="./img/board-images/king.png" alt=""></a> shouted - no bird could live that long.
                </p>
                <p>And the shepherd boy <a href="#1" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/shepherd.png"
                            alt=""></a> very wisely said: </p>
                <p><span class="book__ident">-</span> And no love would live so short.</p>
                <p>The king, very impressed by the boy's remarkable wisdom, said confidently:</p>
                <span class="book__page-number"></span>

            <div class="book__page">

                    shalt henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace, and I will regard thee as my own child.</p>
                <p>Addressing the people in the palace, the king <a href="#2" class="indicator"><img
                            src="./img/board-images/king.png" alt=""></a> said:</p>
                <p>Let us have a feast <a href="#9" class="indicator"><img src="./img/board-images/feast.png"
