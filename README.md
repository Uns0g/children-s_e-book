# Children's E-book

This is a "final project" I did based on the challenge of 10 projects in 1 hour that [florin pop](https://github.com/florinpop17) did in his youtube channel.  
  
## Description

It works like an e-book with some small figures on it which indicate what button the reader should press in the sound board at the right side.  
The story in this small e-book is a [brothers' grimm one](https://www.grimmstories.com/en/grimm_fairy-tales/the_shepherd_boy) adapted (almost completely changed) by me.
