# Children's E-book

This is a "final project" I did based on the challenge of 10 projects in 1 hour that [florin pop](https://github.com/florinpop17) did in his youtube channel.  
  
## Description

It works like an e-book with some small figures on it which indicate what button the reader must press in the sound board at the right side.
